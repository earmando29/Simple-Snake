# Simple-Snake
This is a simple snake game. We have all played it or at least heard of it. 
The way I programmed this game is that it is set to work on Mac OS only because of certain features that were implemented.
The game was programmed in c++ so I used the ncurses.h library to create color and use to capture keyboard inputs.

To run the game:
    Go to terminal > Enter "make && ./main" > Enjoy!
